## Shared Systems Touched By Added Traits

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Content.Shared/Strip/SharedStrippableSystem.cs | Adds public helpers for automated strip attempts from inventory slots and hands.

| Content.Server/Traits/Assorted/EnhancedHearingComponent.cs | Marker component for All Ears. |
| Content.Server/Traits/Assorted/EnhancedHearingSystem.cs | Expands chat recipients for entities with EnhancedHearing. |
| Content.Server/Traits/Assorted/KleptomaniaComponent.cs | Stores kleptomania interval, range, risky target flag, floor-item cooldown, and next incident timer. |
| Content.Server/Traits/Assorted/KleptomaniaSystem.cs | Runs involuntary loose-item pickup and strip attempts. Restricts all strip stealing to visible hands or explicit visible worn slots. |
| Resources/Prototypes/_DV/Traits/altvision.yml | Moves UltraVision and DogVision into Physical and assigns costs. |
| Resources/Prototypes/Traits/quirks.yml | Adds TrackingByScent and AllEars trait prototypes. |
| Resources/Prototypes/Traits/disabilities.yml | Adds Clumsiness, Kleptomania, and ChronicKleptomania trait prototypes. Despite the file name, these traits are categorized as Physical or Mental in the character setup UI. |
| Resources/Locale/en-US/traits/traits.ftl | Adds player-facing names and descriptions for the new traits. |
| Resources/Prototypes/Entities/Mobs/Player/clone.yml | Adds EnhancedHearing, Kleptomania, and ScentTracker to clone component copying. DogVision and UltraVision were already clone-whitelisted. |
